## Description

As avid travelers, we at the Tripper team, wanted to come up with a solution to centralize the process of destination narrowing when planning a trip. Users leave reviews of activities and stays. This is an integrated platform for the professional traveler. It is an all-in-one travel sharing venue. Tripper allows you to have the inside scoop on places you plan on visiting and/or leave bread crumbs for other travelers to follow or avoid. It also gives you an option to sort your trips according to ratings.
