# Project Tripper

As avid travelers, we at the Tripper team, wanted to come up with a solution to centralize the organizational process of building an itenerary for a trip; leave reviews of activities and stays; post photos; and get feedback from other travelers. This is an integrated platform for the professional traveler. It is an all-in-one travel sharing venue. Tripper allows you to get travel ideas from other traveler's exploits; have the inside scoop on places you plan on visiting; and also leave some bread crumbs for other travelers to follow or avoid. It also gives you an option to sort your trips according to ratings so the highest rated trips appear first.
