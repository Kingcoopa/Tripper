# Project Tripper

As avid travelers, we at the Tripper team, wanted to come up with a solution to centralize the organizational process of building an itenerary for a trip; leave reviews of activities and stays; post photos; and get feedback from other travelers. This is an integrated platform for the professioanl traveler. It is an all-in-one travel sharing venue. Tripper allow you to get travel ideas from other traveler's exploits; have the inside scoop on places you plan on visiting; and also leave some bread crumbs for other travelers to follow.
